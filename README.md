# uBlockLists

A collection of some lists for uBlock origins to get rid of things that annoy me not covered by other lists to my knowledge.

Currently covers:

- Nexus mods:

Gets rid of annoyances like the excessive Vortex adverts, that even as a premium user you still have to see all the time.

- Nexus mods footer:

Gets rid of the footer at the bottom, which in a lot of places can be half the page. You don't really need it to navigate the site imo.

- Temp Mail

Removes distractions.

- Reddit

Gets rid of premium mentions, coins and similar annoyances.
